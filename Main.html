      <h2>Claim</h3>  
      <p>The black box has a mechanism that divides water that inevitably drains into the output.</p>
      <h2>Evidence</h3> 
      <p>The Black box Took water in and gave out water most tests resulted in less out but some resulted in more out.</p>
    <h2>Reasoning</h2>
      <h3>Part 1</h3> 
      <p>Output- a tube in the middle of the box
Input- a funnel of the top of box
Black Box- A Sealed Black Box with an input and output 
</p>
      <h3>Part 2</h3>
      <p>It shows me that there is a mechanism in the box because not all the water is returned at once </p>
      <h3>Part 3</h3>
      <p>If there was not a mechanism that divides water that later drains into an output, our observations of the real mystery black box would have been different.  Specifically, there would be a direct correlation between input and output.</p>
